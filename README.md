# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-Neural-Networks

Goal:

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and reliable predictive model for diabetes using advanced data science techniques. The primary objective is to provide healthcare professionals with a tool that not only identifies the likelihood of diabetes early on but also offers valuable insights into the impact of various factors on diabetes risk.

Scope:

Model Development:
Implement logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks for diabetes prediction.
Investigate the impacts of gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level on diabetes.Explor combinations of parameters that make a person more likely to develop diabetes.

Data Visualization:
Utilize data visualization techniques (histograms, scatterplots, boxplots) to gain insights into relationships between variables. Enhance interpretability and understanding of the dataset.

Continuous Improvement:
Address potential dataset issues and propose future enhancements for continuous refinement.Strive for a balance between model interpretability and complexity.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning:

Handling Missing Data:
Remove missing values, ensuring accuracy and reliability of results.
Data Transformation:
Transform categorical variables, such as 'Smoking History,' for better model compatibility.

Model Development:

Logistic Regression:
Develop a binary classification model providing interpretable results.Utilize stepwise selection for variable inclusion.

Decision Trees:
Leverage decision trees for identifying important variables contributing to diabetes prediction.
Implement pruning techniques for model optimization.

Neural Networks:
Employ neural networks to capture non-linear relationships in complex data.Assess model performance and fine-tune as necessary.

Data Visualization:

Histograms, Scatterplots, Boxplots:
Visualize data characteristics to identify outliers, trends, and patterns.Enhance understanding of variables and their impact on diabetes.

Model Performance Evaluation:
The logistic regression model exhibited outstanding accuracy at 94.75%, with a specificity of 97.77% and a sensitivity of 67.98%. Comparative analysis with decision trees and neural networks provided valuable insights into alternative modeling approaches.

Conclusions and Recommendations:

Key Findings:
Age, BMI, Normal Hemoglobin A1c Level, and Blood Glucose emerged as significant predictors of diabetes risk.The logistic regression model excelled in accuracy, providing a balance between interpretability and performance.

Recommendations:
Encourage regular monitoring of HbA1c and blood glucose levels for individuals at risk.
Utilize the logistic regression model for its accuracy and interpretability in clinical settings.
Further research into refining models for personalized risk assessments and tailored interventions.
